## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was the first time I implemented a filter on an image to change the image color and saturation.  

```
img { 
    width: 100%;
    border-radius: 10px 10px 0 0;
    filter: brightness(50%) sepia(50) saturate(40) hue-rotate(257deg);
}
```

### Continued development

For my next project I would like to start implementing SASS/SCSS to become more familiar with other types of styling.
